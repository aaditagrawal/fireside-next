## Deployment Components

### Client Tier
- **Web Browser**: Users access the application through standard web browsers on desktop or mobile devices.

### Edge Network / CDN
- **Content Delivery Network**: Distributes static assets globally to reduce latency and improve load times.

### Application Tier
- **Next.js Server**: Serves the React application with server-side rendering capabilities.
- **API Service**: Handles client requests, processes business logic, and interacts with the database.
- **Background Services**:
  - **Feed Processor Service**: Fetches and processes RSS feeds from external sources.
  - **Recommendation Engine**: Analyzes user behavior and generates personalized content recommendations.
  - **Scheduled Feed Updates**: Periodically refreshes feeds to ensure content is up-to-date.

### Database Tier
- **MariaDB Cluster**:
  - **Primary Node**: Handles write operations and maintains data consistency.
  - **Read Replicas**: Scale read operations and provide redundancy.
- **Backup Service**: Ensures regular database backups for disaster recovery.

### Storage Tier
- **Object Storage**:
  - **Feed Content Cache**: Stores processed feed content to reduce database load.
  - **Article Images**: Hosts images extracted from feed content.
  - **User Data**: Stores user-specific files and preferences.

### Authentication
- **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Session Store**: Maintains user session information.

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Log Aggregator**: Centralizes application logs for analysis.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks system performance and user engagement.
- **Alerts System**: Notifies administrators of system issues.

## External Connections
- **Publisher RSS Feeds**: External content sources that the system fetches and processes.

## Scalability Considerations

This architecture is designed to scale horizontally by:

1. **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple application servers.
2. **Read Replicas**: Scaling database read operations separately from writes.
3. **Content Caching**: Reducing database load by caching frequently accessed content.
4. **Background Processing**: Handling resource-intensive tasks asynchronously.

## High Availability Features

The system ensures high availability through:

1. **Database Clustering**: Primary-replica configuration for database redundancy.
2. **Geographic Distribution**: CDN for global content delivery.
3. **Regular Backups**: Automated database and content backups.
4. **Monitoring**: Proactive issue detection and alerting.

## Security Measures

Security is addressed through:

1. **HTTPS Encryption**: All client-server communication is encrypted.
2. **Authentication Service**: Centralized authentication with secure token management.
3. **Database Access Control**: Limited database access patterns.
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging for security analysis.

This deployment architecture provides a scalable, secure, and reliable platform for the Project Fireside RSS aggregator application.
