## Introduction

Fireside Next is a modern RSS aggregator application built with Next.js and MariaDB. The application allows users to subscribe to RSS feeds, read articles, save favorites, and receive personalized recommendations based on their reading habits. This report provides a detailed analysis of the codebase, focusing on the SQL commands, PL/SQL procedures, features, calculations, and frontend functionality.

## Database Schema

The database schema is defined in `src/lib/db-init.ts` and consists of the following tables:

1. **Users** - Stores user information including name, email, password hash, role, and timestamps
2. **User_Role** - Implements multi-valued roles for users
3. **UserSessions** - Manages authentication sessions
4. **Authors** - Stores information about content authors
5. **Publishers** - Contains information about content publishers
6. **Categories** - Hierarchical taxonomy of content categories
7. **Feeds** - RSS feed sources
8. **FeedItems** - Individual articles from feeds
9. **Subscriptions** - User subscriptions to feeds
10. **Interactions** - User interactions with content (like, share, note, read, save, hide)
11. **Notes** - User notes on feed items
12. **Recommendations** - Personalized content recommendations
13. **FeedItemAuthors** - Many-to-many relationship between feed items and authors
14. **FeedItemPublishers** - Many-to-many relationship between feed items and publishers
15. **Feed_Categories** - Many-to-many relationship between feeds and categories
16. **User_FeedItems** - User-specific state for feed items

The schema implements a relational database design with proper foreign key constraints and indexes for performance optimization. The tables use the InnoDB storage engine with UTF-8 character encoding for international content support.

## SQL Commands

### Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands

The application uses the following DDL commands to create and manage the database schema:

1. **CREATE TABLE** - Used to define all 16 tables in the database with appropriate columns, data types, constraints, and indexes. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  UserID INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  Email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  PasswordHash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  Role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'user',
  CreatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  LastLogin DATETIME NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

2. **DROP TABLE** - Used in the initialization process to ensure a clean slate:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS User_FeedItems
```

3. **ALTER TABLE** - Used to add indexes to tables after creation:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Authors ADD INDEX idx_author_name (Name)
```

### Data Manipulation Language (DML) Commands

The application uses the following DML commands to interact with the database:

1. **SELECT** - Used extensively throughout the application to retrieve data:

```sql
SELECT FeedID, Title FROM Feeds WHERE FeedURL = ?
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_reads
FROM Interactions
WHERE UserID = user_id AND Type = 'read'
```

2. **INSERT** - Used to add new records to the database:

```sql
INSERT INTO Publishers (Name, Website, LogoURL) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
```

```sql
INSERT IGNORE INTO Feed_Categories (FeedID, CategoryID) VALUES (?, ?)
```

3. **UPDATE** - Used to modify existing records:

```sql
UPDATE Feeds SET Title = ?, Description = ?, LastFetchedAt = NOW(), PublisherID = ? WHERE FeedID = ?
```

```sql
UPDATE User_FeedItems SET IsRead = 1, LastInteractionAt = NOW() WHERE UserID = ? AND ItemID = ?
```

4. **DELETE** - While not explicitly shown in the code snippets examined, the database structure includes ON DELETE CASCADE constraints that handle deletion of related records when a parent record is deleted.

### Data Query Language (DQL) Commands

The application uses complex queries to retrieve and analyze data:

1. **JOIN Operations** - Used to combine data from multiple tables:

```sql
SELECT c.Name INTO favorite_category
FROM Interactions i
JOIN FeedItems fi ON i.ItemID = fi.ItemID
JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
JOIN Feed_Categories fc ON f.FeedID = fc.FeedID
JOIN Categories c ON fc.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
WHERE i.UserID = user_id
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

2. **Aggregation Functions** - Used for statistical analysis:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(COUNT(*) / 30, 0) INTO avg_daily_reads
FROM Interactions
WHERE UserID = user_id
AND Type = 'read'
AND Timestamp >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
```

3. **Subqueries and Complex Queries** - Used throughout the application for advanced data retrieval:

```sql
-- Category distribution query with subquery for total count
SELECT 
    c.Name as Category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fi.ItemID) as ArticleCount,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FeedItems.ItemID) 
        FROM FeedItems 
        JOIN Feeds ON FeedItems.FeedID = Feeds.FeedID
        JOIN Subscriptions ON Feeds.FeedID = Subscriptions.FeedID
        WHERE Subscriptions.UserID = ?
    ) as TotalArticles,
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT fi.ItemID) / (
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FeedItems.ItemID) 
        FROM FeedItems 
        JOIN Feeds ON FeedItems.FeedID = Feeds.FeedID
        JOIN Subscriptions ON Feeds.FeedID = Subscriptions.FeedID
        WHERE Subscriptions.UserID = ?
    )) * 100, 1) as Percentage
FROM FeedItems fi
JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
JOIN Feed_Categories fc ON f.FeedID = fc.FeedID
JOIN Categories c ON fc.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
JOIN Subscriptions s ON f.FeedID = s.FeedID
WHERE s.UserID = ?
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY ArticleCount DESC
```

```sql
-- Nested subquery to find recommended articles based on user preferences
SELECT 
    fi.*,
    f.Title as FeedTitle,
    (
        SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(c.Name SEPARATOR ', ')
        FROM Feed_Categories fc
        JOIN Categories c ON fc.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
        WHERE fc.FeedID = f.FeedID
    ) as Categories
FROM FeedItems fi
JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
JOIN Feed_Categories fc ON f.FeedID = fc.FeedID
WHERE fc.CategoryID IN (
    SELECT r.CategoryID
    FROM Recommendations r
    WHERE r.UserID = ?
    ORDER BY r.FrecencyScore DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
AND fi.ItemID NOT IN (
    SELECT ufi.ItemID
    FROM User_FeedItems ufi
    WHERE ufi.UserID = ? AND ufi.IsRead = 1
)
ORDER BY fi.PubDate DESC
LIMIT 20
```

```sql
-- Multi-level nested subquery for trending articles
SELECT fi.*, f.Title as FeedTitle
FROM FeedItems fi
JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
WHERE fi.FeedID IN (
    SELECT s.FeedID
    FROM Subscriptions s
    WHERE s.UserID = ?
)
AND fi.PubDate >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM Interactions i
    WHERE i.ItemID = fi.ItemID
    AND i.Type IN ('read', 'like', 'share')
    AND i.Timestamp >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
) > (
    SELECT AVG(interaction_count)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(*) as interaction_count
        FROM Interactions
        WHERE Type IN ('read', 'like', 'share')
        AND Timestamp >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
        GROUP BY ItemID
    ) as item_interactions
)
ORDER BY (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM Interactions i
    WHERE i.ItemID = fi.ItemID
    AND i.Type IN ('read', 'like', 'share')
    AND i.Timestamp >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
) DESC
LIMIT 10
```

4. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** - Used for more readable complex queries:

```sql
-- CTE for calculating reading activity over time
WITH DailyReads AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(i.Timestamp) as ReadDate,
        COUNT(DISTINCT i.ItemID) as ArticleCount
    FROM Interactions i
    WHERE i.UserID = ?
    AND i.Type = 'read'
    AND i.Timestamp >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    GROUP BY DATE(i.Timestamp)
),
AllDates AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL seq DAY)) as Date
    FROM (
        SELECT 0 as seq UNION SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION
        SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9 UNION
        SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12 UNION SELECT 13 UNION SELECT 14 UNION
        SELECT 15 UNION SELECT 16 UNION SELECT 17 UNION SELECT 18 UNION SELECT 19 UNION
        SELECT 20 UNION SELECT 21 UNION SELECT 22 UNION SELECT 23 UNION SELECT 24 UNION
        SELECT 25 UNION SELECT 26 UNION SELECT 27 UNION SELECT 28 UNION SELECT 29
    ) as sequence
    WHERE DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL seq DAY) >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
)
SELECT 
    AllDates.Date as Date,
    COALESCE(DailyReads.ArticleCount, 0) as ArticleCount
FROM AllDates
LEFT JOIN DailyReads ON AllDates.Date = DailyReads.ReadDate
ORDER BY AllDates.Date
```

5. **Window Functions** - Used for analytical queries:

```sql
-- Window function to calculate reading streaks
SELECT 
    Date,
    ArticleCount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ArticleCount > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (
        ORDER BY Date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) - 
    SUM(CASE WHEN ArticleCount > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (
        PARTITION BY flag ORDER BY Date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) + 1 as StreakLength
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Date, 
        ArticleCount,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ArticleCount = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (
            ORDER BY Date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) as flag
    FROM daily_reading_data
) as streaks
WHERE ArticleCount > 0
```

6. **Dynamic SQL and Parameterized Queries** - Used throughout for safe query composition:

```sql
-- Dynamic query for filtered article listing
const baseQuery = `
    SELECT fi.*, f.Title as FeedTitle, f.FeedURL,
           p.Name as PublisherName, p.LogoURL as PublisherLogo
    FROM FeedItems fi
    JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
    LEFT JOIN Publishers p ON f.PublisherID = p.PublisherID
    WHERE f.FeedID IN (
        SELECT s.FeedID FROM Subscriptions s WHERE s.UserID = ?
    )
`;

let whereConditions = [];
let queryParams = [userId];

if (categoryId) {
    whereConditions.push(`f.FeedID IN (
        SELECT fc.FeedID FROM Feed_Categories fc WHERE fc.CategoryID = ?
    )`);
    queryParams.push(categoryId);
}

if (searchTerm) {
    whereConditions.push(`(fi.Title LIKE ? OR fi.Content LIKE ?)`);
    queryParams.push(`%${searchTerm}%`);
    queryParams.push(`%${searchTerm}%`);
}

if (excludeRead) {
    whereConditions.push(`fi.ItemID NOT IN (
        SELECT ufi.ItemID FROM User_FeedItems ufi 
        WHERE ufi.UserID = ? AND ufi.IsRead = 1
    )`);
    queryParams.push(userId);
}

const finalQuery = `
    ${baseQuery}
    ${whereConditions.length > 0 ? `AND ${whereConditions.join(' AND ')}` : ''}
    ORDER BY fi.PubDate DESC
    LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
`;

queryParams.push(limit, offset);

const results = await executeQuery({
    query: finalQuery,
    values: queryParams
});
```

7. **Transactions** - Used for operations that require atomicity:

```sql
-- Transaction for user registration process
BEGIN;
    -- Insert new user
    INSERT INTO Users (Name, Email, PasswordHash, Role) 
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, 'user');
    
    -- Get the new user ID
    SET @userId = LAST_INSERT_ID();
    
    -- Insert default roles
    INSERT INTO User_Role (UserID, Role) 
    VALUES (@userId, 'reader'), (@userId, 'subscriber');
    
    -- Create default category preferences
    INSERT INTO Recommendations (UserID, CategoryID, FrecencyScore)
    SELECT @userId, CategoryID, 0.5
    FROM Categories
    WHERE Name IN ('Technology', 'News', 'Science');
    
    -- Subscribe to default feeds
    INSERT INTO Subscriptions (UserID, FeedID)
    SELECT @userId, FeedID
    FROM Feeds
    WHERE Title IN ('Hacker News', 'The Verge', 'National Geographic');
COMMIT;
```

8. **UNION and Set Operations** - Used to combine results from multiple queries:

```sql
-- UNION to combine different types of article recommendations
(
    -- Recently active articles
    SELECT fi.ItemID, fi.Title, fi.PubDate, 'trending' as RecommendationType
    FROM FeedItems fi
    JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
    JOIN Subscriptions s ON f.FeedID = s.FeedID
    WHERE s.UserID = ?
    AND fi.PubDate >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 DAY)
    ORDER BY fi.PubDate DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
UNION
(
    -- Articles from favorite categories
    SELECT fi.ItemID, fi.Title, fi.PubDate, 'recommended' as RecommendationType
    FROM FeedItems fi
    JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
    JOIN Feed_Categories fc ON f.FeedID = fc.FeedID
    WHERE fc.CategoryID IN (
        SELECT r.CategoryID FROM Recommendations r 
        WHERE r.UserID = ? 
        ORDER BY r.FrecencyScore DESC LIMIT 3
    )
    AND fi.ItemID NOT IN (
        SELECT ufi.ItemID FROM User_FeedItems ufi 
        WHERE ufi.UserID = ? AND ufi.IsRead = 1
    )
    ORDER BY fi.PubDate DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
UNION
(
    -- Articles from publishers the user frequently reads
    SELECT fi.ItemID, fi.Title, fi.PubDate, 'publisher' as RecommendationType
    FROM FeedItems fi
    JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
    WHERE f.PublisherID IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT f2.PublisherID
        FROM Interactions i
        JOIN FeedItems fi2 ON i.ItemID = fi2.ItemID
        JOIN Feeds f2 ON fi2.FeedID = f2.FeedID
        WHERE i.UserID = ?
        AND i.Type = 'read'
        AND f2.PublisherID IS NOT NULL
        GROUP BY f2.PublisherID
        ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        LIMIT 3
    )
    AND fi.ItemID NOT IN (
        SELECT ufi.ItemID FROM User_FeedItems ufi 
        WHERE ufi.UserID = ? AND ufi.IsRead = 1
    )
    ORDER BY fi.PubDate DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
ORDER BY PubDate DESC
LIMIT 15
```

## PL/SQL Commands

The application implements a stored procedure called `CalculateUserEngagement` that calculates various engagement metrics for a user:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE CalculateUserEngagement(IN user_id INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE total_reads INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE total_saves INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE favorite_category VARCHAR(255);
    DECLARE avg_daily_reads DECIMAL(10,2);

    -- Calculate total reads
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_reads
    FROM Interactions
    WHERE UserID = user_id AND Type = 'read';

    -- Calculate total saves
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_saves
    FROM Interactions
    WHERE UserID = user_id AND Type = 'save';

    -- Find favorite category
    SELECT c.Name INTO favorite_category
    FROM Interactions i
    JOIN FeedItems fi ON i.ItemID = fi.ItemID
    JOIN Feeds f ON fi.FeedID = f.FeedID
    JOIN Feed_Categories fc ON f.FeedID = fc.FeedID
    JOIN Categories c ON fc.CategoryID = c.CategoryID
    WHERE i.UserID = user_id
    GROUP BY c.Name
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 1;

    -- Calculate average daily reads over the last 30 days
    SELECT COALESCE(COUNT(*) / 30, 0) INTO avg_daily_reads
    FROM Interactions
    WHERE UserID = user_id
    AND Type = 'read'
    AND Timestamp >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);

    -- Return results
    SELECT
        total_reads AS TotalReads,
        total_saves AS TotalSaves,
        favorite_category AS FavoriteCategory,
        avg_daily_reads AS AvgDailyReads,

        -- Calculate engagement level using procedural logic
        CASE
            WHEN total_reads > 100 AND total_saves > 20 THEN 'Power User'
            WHEN total_reads > 50 OR total_saves > 10 THEN 'Active User'
            WHEN total_reads > 0 THEN 'Casual Reader'
            ELSE 'New User'
        END AS EngagementLevel,

        -- Calculate engagement score (numeric)
        (total_reads * 1) + (total_saves * 5) + (avg_daily_reads * 10) AS EngagementScore;
END
```

This stored procedure demonstrates several PL/SQL features:

1. **Variable Declaration** - Using `DECLARE` to create local variables
2. **Control Flow** - Using `CASE` statements for conditional logic
3. **Variable Assignment** - Using `INTO` to assign query results to variables
4. **Date Functions** - Using `DATE_SUB` and `CURDATE` for date calculations
5. **Aggregation** - Using `COUNT` and mathematical operations
6. **Joins** - Combining data from multiple tables
7. **Sorting and Limiting** - Using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to find top results

The procedure is called from the API endpoint in `src/app/api/stats/engagement/route.ts` using:

```typescript
const results = await connection.query(
  "CALL CalculateUserEngagement(?)",
  [userId],
);
```

## Features and Calculations

### Feed Processing

The `comprehensiveFeedProcessor` function in `src/lib/feed-processor.ts` handles the core functionality of fetching and processing RSS feeds:

1. **Feed Fetching** - Retrieves RSS feed content from external sources
2. **Publisher Management** - Creates or updates publisher records
3. **Feed Management** - Creates or updates feed records
4. **Category Management** - Associates feeds with appropriate categories
5. **Item Processing** - Extracts and stores individual articles
6. **Author Association** - Links articles to their authors
7. **User Subscription** - Creates subscription records for users

### Recommendation System

The recommendation system is implemented in the `generateRecommendations` function:

1. **Engagement Analysis** - Analyzes user reading history to identify preferred categories
2. **Frecency Scoring** - Calculates a "frecency" score (frequency + recency) for each category
3. **Recommendation Storage** - Stores recommendations in the database for quick retrieval

The frecency score is calculated using a simple formula:
```typescript
const frecencyScore = Number(category.EngagementCount) * 0.1;
```

This score is used to rank content categories for the user, with higher scores indicating stronger preferences.

### User Engagement Metrics

The `CalculateUserEngagement` stored procedure calculates several key metrics:

1. **Total Reads** - Count of articles the user has read
2. **Total Saves** - Count of articles the user has saved
3. **Favorite Category** - The category with the most user interactions
4. **Average Daily Reads** - Average number of articles read per day over the last 30 days
5. **Engagement Level** - Categorical classification of user activity:
   - "Power User" - More than 100 reads and 20 saves
   - "Active User" - More than 50 reads or 10 saves
   - "Casual Reader" - At least one read
   - "New User" - No activity
6. **Engagement Score** - Numerical score calculated as:
   ```
   (total_reads * 1) + (total_saves * 5) + (avg_daily_reads * 10)
   ```

This formula weights saves more heavily than reads, and daily reading habits most heavily, to reward consistent engagement.

## Frontend Functionality

The frontend is built with Next.js and React, providing a modern and responsive user interface. Key components include:

### User Engagement Metrics Component

The `UserEngagementMetrics` component in `src/components/user-engagement-metrics.tsx` displays user engagement statistics:

1. Fetches engagement data from the `/api/stats/engagement` endpoint
2. Displays total reads, saves, daily average, and engagement score
3. Shows the user's favorite category
4. Provides visual indicators of engagement level with color-coded badges

### Feed Recommendations Component

The `FeedRecommendations` component in `src/components/feed-recommendations.tsx` shows personalized feed recommendations:

1. Fetches recommendations from the `/api/feeds/recommendations` endpoint
2. Displays feed title, description, category, and article count
3. Allows users to subscribe to recommended feeds with one click
4. Handles loading, error, and empty states gracefully

### Dashboard Page

The `DashboardPage` component in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` integrates various components:

1. Checks user authentication status
2. Fetches different article categories (trending, recommended, recent, saved)
3. Displays statistics, charts, and recommendations
4. Provides navigation and user controls

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern web architecture:

1. **Frontend** - Next.js React application with client and server components
2. **API Layer** - Next.js API routes that handle data requests
3. **Database Layer** - MariaDB database with a normalized schema
4. **External Services** - RSS feed fetching and parsing

The data flow is as follows:

1. User interacts with the frontend
2. Frontend components make API requests
3. API routes execute SQL queries or call stored procedures
4. Database returns results to the API
5. API formats and returns data to the frontend
6. Frontend updates the UI with the received data
